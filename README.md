A random piece of chaos I made. My second java mod aside Ion (prior to the kotlin port of it), my main project.

There's also the unmaintained [JS version](https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow) if you need it for some reason. (Don't use it, it contains the old bullethell configurations which are pieces of absolute batshit.)
