# Yellow (Java)

A random piece of chaos i made. My second java mod aside Ion, my currently postponed mod. (It's not easy to maintain 2 java mods.)

There's also the unmaintained [JS version](https://github.com/SMOLKEYS/yellow) if you need it for some reason. (Don't use it, it contains the old bullethell configurations which are pieces of absolute batshit.)
