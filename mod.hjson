Chaos in a mod!

Uprising from a basic shitpost JS mod to the very Java mod that defines my shitposting...
...meet [yellow]Yellow[]!

Features:

    - Yellow, the unit stronger than vanilla units but weaker than most modded units
    - 10+ disableable weapons for Yellow of varying powers
    - Spells (or Abilities)! Things that make Yellow do funny stuff
    - 5 lives for Yellow, which invoke different effects for each life lost (this is 4/5th lie 1/5th truth)
    
As time passes, even more features will arrive. Come along!
